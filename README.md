# Install Brave Browser for Debian

Bash script to make copy-pasting all those nasty little commands from https://brave.com/linux/ on Debian based systems. Very simple, hope brave will put something like this on their site, I know people who find it intimidating for new to linux users.

#### Have a nice day!
