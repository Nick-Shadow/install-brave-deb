# Install Brave Browser for Debian

Bash script to make copy-pasting all those nasty little commands from https://brave.com/linux/ on Debian based systems. Very simple, hope brave will put something like this on their site, I know people who find it intimidating for new to linux users.

Instead of being thrown with all those commands you just get a curl, wget, or clone (with potentially a shorter url that makes sense like AUR urls) and then `install-brave.sh`. It feels more complete *(to me)*.

#### Have a nice day!
